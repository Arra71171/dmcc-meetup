## Style Guidelines:

- Light Mode Palette. Base gradient: Soft Coral → Lavender Mist — gentle pastel that reads clean yet vibrant. Glass layer: white/near-transparent overlay with ~20–30% opacity and 20px backdrop blur. Accents: Use charcoal grey (#333333) for text/icons to ensure contrast and legibility. Suggested Gradient Stops: background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FFC4C4 (warm peach), #E0C3FC (lavender));
- Dark Mode Palette. Base gradient: Midnight Blue → Cosmic Purple — bold yet sophisticated; highlights depth and complements the glass texture. Glass layer: semi-transparent charcoal/soft black overlay (30–40%) with blur. Accents: Pure white or very light greys for sharp contrast. Suggested Gradient Stops: background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1B2245, #5D2A8E);
- Backdrop blur is key: aim for 15–25px blur on divs to create that “frosted glass” feel. Layering matters: place these glass cards over dynamic backgrounds to emphasize depth. Balanced use: don’t overuse—glass elements should draw attention to calls‑to‑action or highlight content.
- 3‑Font Google Combination. A modern triple combo that complements both light & dark, all with great readability: Montserrat (Headings – geometric sans‑serif; bold, uppercase, crisp), Inter (Sub‑headings / UI text – clean, neutral, high legibility), Lora (Body copy – serif with nice contrast; complements the sans‑family) — provides warmth and readability. This trio balances modern structure, clarity, and human touch.
- Hero / Header: Use background gradient, then place a glass-card overlay with event title in Montserrat, subtext in Inter.
- Sections: Alternate light/dark backgrounds or toggle dark mode. Embed blurred glass panels for timetable, speaker-intros, or CTAs.
- Typography Hierarchy: Headings: Montserrat (e.g., 56px Bold), Sub-headings/UI: Inter (e.g., 24px Medium), Body/Text: Lora (e.g., 16px Regular)
